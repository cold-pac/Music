    <li>Gonna keep these notes nice and simple, quick</li>
    <li>This will be a very, very cool thing to learn</li>
    <li>remember, you idiot, a class lays out the blueprint for an object, we call the class to create a new object (instance of the class)</li>
    <li>Every sound/instrument is an object (that you create by calling a class), which you can completely configure as much as you want (like speechSynthesisVoice). You create a sound with the "instrument" object by calling a method on it (remember, idiot, a method is a function within an object/class)</li>
